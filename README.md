üîê Steganography Using LSB Technique
<br>
This project demonstrates how secret messages can be hidden inside images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. By modifying the last bit of each pixel in a grayscale image, we can embed a message without visibly altering the image. The process includes encoding a text message into the image and later decoding it back from the modified image. It's a simple and effective method of hiding information for secure communication.
